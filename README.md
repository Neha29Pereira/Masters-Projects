# Health Risk Dataset 
In the Dataset, we are using a "Maternal Health Risk Dataset," and we found it from 'Kaggle' platform. 

The dataset contains information of 1014 Patients. Altogether, the data has got seven columns for each of the patients. 

Each patient has got the data consisting of their Age, Systolic BP (Blood Pressure), Diastolic BP (Blood Pressure), BS (Blood Sugar), Body Temperature, Heart Rate and Risk level.

Most of the Data are Continuous Data in the dataset. A continuous Data is a dataset where the numericals are continuous in nature and can take on any value within a certain range.

If the data had been collected directly from patients, it would have been collected in Numerical data type. A "Numerical data type" is described as the data types that are applied to represent numeric values.

# Overview
This dataset consists of 1014 rows and 7 columns. In the dataset, each row represents an individual's health profile, and the columns contain the following information:

Age: Age of the individual in years.

SystolicBP: Systolic blood pressure reading in mmHg.

DiastolicBP: Diastolic blood pressure reading in mmHg.

BS: Blood sugar level in mg/dL.

BodyTemp: Body temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

HeartRate: Heart rate in beats per minute.

RiskLevel: Assigned risk level based on the individual's health parameters (e.g., high risk, low risk, mid risk).

# Results:
  The accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are printed to the console for analysis.
The Decision Tree Model achieved an accuracy of approximately 81.77%.  

The Random Forest Model demonstrates a strong performance on the test set, achieving an accuracy of approximately 81.28%.
The model demonstrates a favorable ability to predict labels correctly, as given by evaluation metrics, including the confusion matrix and classification report.
